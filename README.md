# Unity Fractal

**Unity Fractal** is a project developed using the Unity game engine that demonstrates the creation and visualization of fractals. This project showcases advanced techniques in procedural generation and rendering within Unity.

### Source
- **Fractal.cs:** Manages the logic for generating and rendering fractals.
- **FractalPart.cs:** Defines individual parts of the fractal structure.

## Features

- **Procedural Generation:** Utilizes procedural generation techniques to create intricate fractal patterns.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** Ensures efficient rendering of fractals in real-time.
- **Unity Integration:** Leverages Unity's capabilities for smooth and interactive fractal visualization.

This project serves as an excellent example for developers interested in exploring procedural generation and advanced rendering techniques using the Unity game engine.
